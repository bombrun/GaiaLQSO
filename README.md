Some ideas for modelling and analysing strong lensed QSO in GAIA DR2 data set.

The folder lens contains python code for SIE and SIS lens modelling, plotting and basic inference. 
The folder gaiapix contains python code to make healpix map easier.
The folder data contains some data.


The folder [notebooks](notebooks) contains a list of notebooks. 

The SIS and SIE series shows how to simulate Gaia like lensed QSO including proper motion based on SIE lens model and the inference ones explore some inference Bayesian models trying to quantify the significance of the relative lens-source proper motion for some simulated LQSO.

The simulation series expose the strategy used to simulate data/simDataSet1.csv.gzip, a Gaia DR2 like query search around some known QSOs.
